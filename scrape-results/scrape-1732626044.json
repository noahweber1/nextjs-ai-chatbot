The Fryst PCMs are chilling molecules that provide a cooling sensation by transforming from a solid to liquid state when heated by the body. Celliant is a unique fiber that utilizes natural minerals to transform your body\u2019s heat into waves of energy. The energy is then reflected back to you through the medium of fibers, helping to enhance faster recovery and promote quality of sleep.\nLearn More\nFrequently Asked Questions\nHow would you rate the firmness of the Bear Elite Hybrid Mattress?\nWe rate the Firm at 7, the Medium at 6, and the Soft at 5. If you are torn between which feel is best for you, we recommend Medium. With over 80% of sleepers preferring a mattress with a firmness rating between 5.5 and 7.5, the Medium falls right in that sweet spot.\nWhat is the difference between the Bear Elite Hybrid and Bear Hybrid Mattress?\nThe Elite Hybrid utilizes a Phase Change Material (PCM) that is cool to the touch and advanced zoned-coils for added pressure point relief from head to toe. The Elite Hybrid also offers you an extra inch of cooling comfort and three different firmness-levels to choose between for the ultimate in mattress luxury. Both the Elite Hybrid and Hybrid mattress have Sleep Recovery Technology\u2122 powered by Celliant\u2122 for faster recovery and natural Copper for a cleaner night\u2019s sleep.\nCan I customize the firmness of the Bear Elite Hybrid Mattress?\nUnfortunately, we cannot offer individual firmness customization on the mattress. Luckily, it comes in three different comfort levels - Soft (plushest feel), Medium (most popular), and Firm (best for heavier sleepers) \u2014 so we have no doubt you will find one that suits you perfectly.\nIs the Bear Elite Hybrid made in the USA?\nWe are proud that all Elite Hybrid mattresses are made in the USA using foreign and domestic components. By owning the factory we\u2019re able to control product quality to meet the highest standards, offer competitive prices, and ship them directly to our customers.\nView More FAQ\nBetter Sleep to Boost Recovery\nYES, INCLUDE IT\nCLOSE\nTitle\nClose\nProduct Pricing Details\nWe strive to bring you the lowest prices.
